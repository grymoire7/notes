# An Opinionated Guide to Memorization

This guide is opinionated in the sense that many choices have been made specifically to minimize conflict
between the various subsystems. Also, 

## The Mnemonic Major System
Simply put, the Mnemonic Major System relates phonetic sounds to the ten decimal digits zero through nine.
For me, learning this system is fundamental to any memory work involving a number.  Card positions, dates,
digits of pi, birthdays, etc.

| Digit | Letters   | Sounds                                   |
| :---: | --------- | ---------------------------------------- |
| 0     | s, c, z   | soft s/c/z, as in sun, ice, or zero      |
| 1     | t, d      | hard t/d, as in tie, dye, or doom        |
| 2     | n         | as in nun, knee, or ninny                |
| 3     | m         | m, as in mom, ammo, or moon              |
| 4     | r         | r, as in rye, roach, or oar              |
| 5     | l         | l, as in lye, owl, or liver              |
| 6     | sh, ch, j | soft sh/ch,j, as in show, chow, or major |
| 7     | k, c, g   | hard c/k/g, as in cow, kite, or goofball |
| 8     | f, v      | soft f/v, as in ivy, fly, or forever     |
| 9     | p, b      | hard p/b, as in pub, puppy, or bubble    |

## Number peg system
It is useful to have standard/peg words for the first 100 or so numbers to
minimize mental faltering when connecting strings of numbers together.
Here we use the mnemonic major system to assign nouns to numbers.  Special care
was taken not to reuse any objects that are used for card mnemonics below to
avoid confusion.  While the nouns were originally taken from Harry Lorrayne's
list, some have been changed to favor something more visual and/or concrete.

## Card system
These were originally based on magician and memory expert Harry Lorrayne's
system for cards.  I've typically associated these with the number system to
memorize a particular card stack, like the Arsonson stack. For magicians,
unlike memory sports, it's important to be able associate the position in the
deck (a number) with the card so that you can access cards by position and vice
versa at random.

Each mnemonic for numbered cards starts with the letter/sound of from the
initial letter of the suit (CHSD) then the number of the card.  For face cards
the Jack is just the suit name, whereas the queen and king start with suit
letter and tries to rhyme with the suit name.

## Letters
As a kid I began playing a game where I memorized the license plate number our
car happened to be following down the road.  As these often included letters,
it was necessary to have mnemonics for those as well.  To keep things clear
and unambiguous in my mind all the letters have animal mnemonics.

| Letter | Animal                       |
| ------ | ---------------------------- |
| A      | Ant :ant:                    |
| B      | Bee                          |
| C      | Camel :camel:                |
| D      | Deer                         |
| E      | Elephant :elephant:          |
| F      | Ferret                       |
| G      | Giraffe                      |
| H      | Hippo                        |
| I      | Ibex                         |
| J      | Jellyfish                    |
| K      | Kangaroo                     |
| L      | LLama                        |
| M      | Moose                        |
| N      | Narwhal                      |
| O      | Octopus :octopus:            |
| P      | Penguin :penguin:            |
| Q      | Quail                        |
| R      | Raccoon                      |
| S      | Snail :snail:                |
| T      | Turtle :turtle:              |
| U      | Umbrellabird                 |
| V      | Vulture                      |
| W      | Walrus                       |
| X      | Xerus (cape ground squirrel) |
| Y      | Yak                          |
| Z      | Zebra                        |

Walking the dog one day as a sixth-grader a car plowed into a row of mail
boxes right in front of me.  Later, a somewhat sceptical police officer got a 
confident report of the license plate number from a diminutive witness.  The 
car was easily found a few minutes later parked just a few blocks away.

## PAO (Person-Action-Object)
A PAO system is most ofen used to memorize a long set of numbers or decks of
playing cards in a memory competition. This PAO system is based on the Major 
number system.

In this system, the number corresponds to the initial sound in the person's 
first and last name, the action, and the object.  The object is from the
peg list above.

For the person, we want to avoid celebrities that have become famous in the last
few decades where possible, since they may become considerably less well-known in 
the future (fame is fleeting you know).

Also, the -ing ending has been added to the end of almost all actions to improve
the readability of the table. Please find a way to cope with it.

## Memory Palaces

The idea behind the memory palace is to take advantage of our genetically
evolved spacial memories.  It works by taking a mental tour of a place you know
well and placing the objects to be memorized (or their representations) in
different places along the tour.

The example here is a place I know well and therefore works well for me. You will
need to substitute your own palces/palaces in order for them to work well for you.

### An example: Presidents

Presidents of the United States with year they began their term.  This palace
is set at the ground level of Burnham Park Plaza, 40 E. 9TH St., Chicago.
You should substitute location from your own memory palace tour in the numbered
location column.

Since this example also encodes the ordinal number of presidency it's natural
to question whether or not a memory palace is actually necessary in this case.
Strictly speaking, no. Though adding another dimension to the mental model
may help to increase recall.  Memory palaces can be especially helpful for 
larger data sets (like this one) or for data without a natural numbering, like
a long oral presentation or story.

## Names
This is a definite work in progress. I used this general system of name mnemonics and
linking them with the persons most striking feature to good effect when I was VP
of the student body in college.  I was the student representative "in charge"
of freshman orientation and met with all incoming freshman.  Being able to
greet them by name weeks later had a strong and lasting effect.

## Card stacks
Our primary application of the card system presented above 
is the memorization of a pre-arranged deck of cards for magical purposes. That
is, you can name the card given the position in the deck (number) and the
position given the name of the card.  Here we link the card names and
numbers using the system above to create mnemonics for the Aronson card stack.

If you are more interested in memorizing the deck in order quickly (no random access)
as they do for memory competitions then you will likely be better served using
the PAO system.

### Quartet Distances for the Aronson stack
Quartet Distances is a concept covered in Pit Hartling's book "In Order to Amaze" (p. 118).
Knowing these quartets enables a new class of named four-of-a-king card effects, explained 
in the same book.

The following list, from Pit's book, gives the suit of the first card of the
quartet followed by the distances to the next three. The "first" card is chosen 
to minimize the distance from the first to last card of the quartet.
